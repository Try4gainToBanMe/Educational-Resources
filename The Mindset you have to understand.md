# Educational-Resources 
Here are some educational resources, notes and sometimes full courses written by my hands, this could be a great start for anyone who is aspiring to learn Cyber in general

Every person will teach you his way of thinking how it worked for >>HIS CASE<< maybe it'll be the same for you, maybe you'll find someone else that will fit you more.
(Think about those League of Legends Pro players and coaches, especially high elo one tricks, they all have a differents view on how to play the game, for Example, Bardinette is a Grandmaster Toplane Bard main, his goal is to leave his lane and let it open at lvl 2 then full roam, his average csing is 40 at 30 min but this guy is still top 0.1 %, see ? He don't play with the same rules as us and he is able to outperform in term of stats). 

Anyways. 

I'm not trying to prove that I am outsmarting everyone, of course it's alot of try and retry especially on subject likes Assembly.

I mentionned earlier that changing your mindset is sometimes more optimal if you wanna learn from someone so here is mine and I highly encourage to adopt it atleast for 2 weeks then leave it if you can't afford to be like me (that must be tiring I agree). 

Here is my mindset 

Education should be free and straight to the point, I am always so happy when I'm looking for some fixes to my bugs and then I find an 2 minutes Youtube videos which can explain me straight to the goal how to fix it, I don't really care about the explanations not gonna lie, even more if you're a outside of the cybersecurity field and you just want to resolve this bug.

___________________________________________

I will give you only interesting and straight to the points facts that you'll need to adopt from now, let's start.

In neurosciences research has revealed that the average adult human is only able to concentrate on a task for around 15 to 20 minutes, suggesting most of us are struggling to maintain focus for long periods of time.

That means if you have a course that last 4h, you have to turn off your brain in order to not pickup the useful informations and only put all your focus on the real facts and things that will be useful.

You will probably have some teachers or mentors in your classrooms.

If I say "A pink Elephant" I bet you had the image of an pink elephant in your head, see ? that's so weak and I managed to make you loose your entire focus aswell as adding up  totally junk "memory image"  in your brain which will increase the chance of you forgetting the farthest memory you had so far. 

It will take practice but you will be able to ignore all those junk images, that will not be easy since we are surrounded by ads nowadays but here is a tip : 

- Don't actively listen to your classmates conversations in class, dont even try to pick up some words, for real we don't care. 
They have no values to add in your learning process, if you feel like you can't ignore them, you're probably bored, here is a quick fix 

(put some earphones with low level "night drive phonk mix" on youtube if possible)

And play this test it'll keep you focused on this game, if you can fully focus on this game for 10 min while ignoring your classmate your brain will slowly get to the fact that you don't care about those conversations anymore, you're a man (or woman) of values, you're above this.

few more talking about your brain and neuroscience and I'll give you my honest process to learn better, atleast for me. 

Let's get back into it, imagine your brain is an attic, in this attic you can stock alot of pictures (the ones that gets out of your polaroid after you take one) 
the quantity of your attic is limited
Each of your memory or thing that you kept in your brain are represented with a new polaroid picture that you stack up at the top of the stack.

everytime you add too much into this stack it doesnt fall but your brain (your attic) has to manage it one way or another, so it delete the picture that it at the bottom of the stack.

this is why it is crucial to mostly pick up and memorize useful infos during your day, we don't care if Rebecca broke up with Dan, seriously, are you really devoted to learn fast ? or do you want to get slowed down by some useless shit. You will have time for that later or during your breaks because you still needs to have fun tho but remember, when you're in class or actually working in front of your computer to learn a new skill at home, do it at 100%, turn off your phone if they're really your friends, they will understand. 

If you want to learn more about the attic comparison, avoid picking up useless informations I recommand your to read "The Monographs" By Ben Cardall and "How to think like Sherlock Holmes" By Maria Konikova

Now for my example : 

I have this teacher that is incredibly talented and probably 100 times better than me, that's a fact. 

But he is paid for his job so he needs to add useless informations to fill the blank until 12.00 AM (09.30 - 11.45 AM generally)

He is talking about shit that no ones care / That won't be useful  

I noticed that alot of students from my prom are focused as fuck during the first hour then at around 10.30 they're litterally all dead or doing their own stuff, no attention anymore. 

During our first courses he talked alot about the First Atari, I know for sure that I won't make any good use of that, this is a typical example of useless junk picture that I refuse to have (I have it now coz it was my first course with him and needed to know his habits), seriously who cares ? We will never use those infos on this shitty ATTARI.

(Once again no offense, he is paid for a 4 h course and he will fill the blank, I'm not blaming anyone I'm using my example for you to understand better)

Remember you only have 20 min of >FULL< Attention span according to Science (I'm talking about actively giving attention at 100% not the passive ones which can go to 1h15 if I remember well ? But with this one you don't pick up all the words, you don't process them all) 

Once I understood that the useful informations was at it the end of his course only I basically openned Youtube, put some music in my ears, worked on the exercises that we had yesterdat etc..

I listenned to the last 30 min of his Assembly courses and turned out I outperformed a good part of my prom (not everyone ofc but with my beginner level it was truly impressive to see my progress compared to the course from the day before) 

I talked alot but trust me this is the only time where I won't go straight to the point (if not needed, sometimes there are some topics where you need to understand) 


To conclude : Pay attention to what you wanna actively listen, don't pick up junk things that will bring you no value in the learning process and it'll help you alot.
